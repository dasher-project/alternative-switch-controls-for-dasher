# Alternative Switch Controls for Dasher
This repository has a proposal for alternative switch controls. The controls
could be used with the Dasher text entry system.

The abstract could be like:

>   Controlling a user interface with imprecise motions without the need for
>   additional (or single-purpose) hardware.
